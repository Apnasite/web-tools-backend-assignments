**Title: Even-Odd Checker**

**Tool Details:**
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js
- **Frontend:** Web Components (vanilla JavaScript, no frameworks)
- **Database:** Not required
- **AI Integration:** Dynamically determine whether a number is even or odd

**Goal:**
Candidates will learn how to build an Express.js backend and integrate it with a WebComponent-based frontend. They will practice API request handling, simple mathematical computations, and dynamic UI updates.

**Assignment Description:**
Candidates will create an Even-Odd Checker where users can input a number, send it to the backend via an API request, and receive a response indicating whether the number is even or odd. The frontend will display the result dynamically.

**Tasks & Steps:**
1. **Backend Development:**
   - Set up an Express.js server.
   - Create an API endpoint that accepts a number from the frontend.
   - Determine whether the number is even or odd using modulo operation.
   - Return the result to the frontend.

2. **Frontend Development:**
   - Create a Web Component for the input form (text field for number input and a check button).
   - Send the user input to the backend via a fetch API request.
   - Receive the response and dynamically display the result on the UI.

3. **Result Display:**
   - Show "Even" or "Odd" based on the API response.
   - Provide an option to check another number.

**Mathematical Calculation/Steps:**
- Use the modulo operator: `number % 2 === 0` â†’ Even, otherwise Odd.

**Third-Party Packages (if required):**
- `express` (for backend server)
- `cors` (to allow frontend-backend communication)
- `body-parser` (to handle JSON requests)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The backend should correctly determine whether the input number is even or odd.
- The frontend should capture user input and dynamically update the UI.
- The API should return valid results based on the given number.
- The Web Component should encapsulate form logic and interaction.
- The result should be clearly displayed to the user.

**Submission Guidelines:**
1. Fork the provided repository.
2. Create a folder with your name inside the repo.
3. Implement both backend and frontend in the designated folder.
4. Push the completed code to your forked repo.
5. Submit a pull request for review.

The assignment is complete when the backend correctly processes the number, returns accurate even/odd results, and the frontend successfully updates the UI based on API responses.
